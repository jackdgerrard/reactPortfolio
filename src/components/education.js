        <h3>So far on my journey to become a web developer</h3>
        <h4>2013-2014</h4>
        <p>
          I first started using HTML in a Fas "intro to web design" course back
          in 2013, after that I studied a Fas I.T maintanence course to get into
          "Networks and web design - level 5" in{" "}

            St John's central college
          </a>{" "}
          in Cork city where I learned some client-side JavaScript, Python,
          HTML, CSS and some network essentials like I.P addresses, mac
          addresses, how to host a website etc....
        </p>
        <h4>2015</h4>
        <p>
          When I finished that course, I started working in a call centre called
          Intercall where I was selling domain names for a company called ‘Minds
          And Machines’, this didn't work out and I left.
        </p>
        <p>
          A month or two later I started working in another call centre who were
          a vendor for the Google Apps for Work platform, now called Google
          Suite. During my time there I was a Gmail specialist, assisting
          customers with various email tasks such as spoof protection, zone file
          editing, settings in the Gmail client and syncing and migrating with
          other platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I worked there I realized that my true calling was in web
          development and spent a great deal of my spare time playing with
          various front-end techniques and libraries for CSS and JavaScript
        </p>
        <h4>2016</h4>
        <p>
          When I was let go from Voxpro at the beginning of 2016 I went back to
          St John's to further my education and did a level 6 certificate in
          "Systems software and networks". This course covered a wide range of
          computer science subjects from Network maintenance and security
          through to terminal usage, during this year I learned more about
          client-side JavaScript, PHP, and C#. I had never been more resolute to
          become a web developer.
        </p>
        <h4>2017</h4>
        <p>
          I was very successful and learned a lot in the last year at St John's,
          so successful that I was able to Join{" "}
